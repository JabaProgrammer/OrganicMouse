# OrganicMouse

OrganicMouse is a lightweight Python library for simulating **smooth**, **natural**, and **human-like** mouse movements.

It generates organic cursor motion with slight imperfections, occasional small overshoots, and natural correction paths â€” making automation look more realistic and undetectable.
